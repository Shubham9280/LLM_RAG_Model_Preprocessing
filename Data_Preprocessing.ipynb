In the right \\nenvironment a vehicle can be maintained and repaired safely and effectively. However, in the wrong environment repairing a vehicle can be dangerous. Follow the tips in this chapter to stay safe. \\nBasic Shop Rules: \\n\\uf0b7Never work alone \\n\\uf0b7Wear eye protection \\n\\uf0b7Avoid loose clothing or hair  \\n\\uf0b7Stay clear of moving parts of a running vehicle \\n\\uf0b7Be aware of hazardous chemicals and keep a flushing station nearby for eyes \\nand skin (at home this could be a bathroom sink or shower). \\n\\uf0b7Keep proper clean up materials in case of an accidental spill (see below) \\n\\uf0b7Don\\x01t mix your work space with other cluttering materials such as home storage, \\ngarden tools and other items. \\n\\uf0b7Never go under a vehicle that is elevated improperly (the jack to change the tire \\nis NOT sufficient, see more details below) \\n\\uf0b7Know where the fire extinguisher is and have a planned exit route. The fire \\nextinguisher should be kept in working order and in a place with easy access. \\n\\uf0b7Keep an emergency response number handy and posted clearly where others \\ncan see it. \\n\\uf0b7Keep an emergency kit in your vehicle for roadside emergencies or repairs. \\n\\uf0b7Consult your vehicle owner\\x01s manual for specific safety rules regarding your \\nvehicle \\nProper Clothing and Hair: Always wear safety goggles for eye protection. Vehicle repair involves the use of many \\ntypes of fluids which can splatter and eye contact should be avoided. \\nEye protection \\nImage credit: CC-BY-Glenn McKechnie \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n3 One of my first bosses didn't have any feeling sensation in his right hand. He couldn\\x01t \\nfeel touch or pain in that hand. He was working alone one night and his hand got caught \\nin the fan belt while the engine was running. He was conscious long enough to get the engine to stop running with his other hand, but his right was stuck and he couldn\\x01t get out on his own. He eventually lost consciousness and lay there bleeding for three hours by himself. Bleeding this long could easily have resulted in death. Luckily he only lost \\nhis fingers. While it was his hand and not a piece of clothing that got caught, the same \\nprinciple applies. If a piece of clothing or hair gets caught it won\\x01t be long before a hand or face gets dragged in with it. \\nDo not wear ties or any loose, hanging clothing. Do not let pony tails down or leave any \\nloose strands of hair. Bundle your hair up if it\\x01s long. Do not w ear necklaces, rings or \\nother jewelry. Some may remember Mr. T, the Mohawk-bearing muscle man from the \\n1980s sitcom The A-Team . He often wore about 50 lbs. of jewelry and frequently \\nworked on motor vehicles. This was a blatant violation of mechanic safety rules. Only a \\nperson who can get thrown out of an airplane, flip a jeep, and come out of machine gun fire without a scratch can work on engines that way. \\nIdeally the best clothing for performing automotive maintenance and repairs is a \\nmechanic\\x01s jumpsuit. It\\x01s durable, comfortable, there are pockets for tools, and there is nothing loose that can get caught and pulled into moving parts. \\nAvoid slips, falls and hazardous chemicals: Hazardous chemicals can include gasoline, oil, coolant, and other vehicle fluids. Avoid \\ncontact with eyes and mouth. If you ever have contact with eyes then flush with cool water for several minutes. Some car fluids can be acidic, such as battery fluid. If you ever start to feel burning, then flush with cool water for several minutes. If burning continues then seek medical attention. \\nProper clean up materials include shop rags and \\x02oil dri\\x03, which is simply kitty litter \\nwithout the fragrance. When a spill occurs you should spread enough \\x02oil dri\\x03 over the spill to absorb the entire spill. Then sweep it up with a broom and dustpan and throw it away. \\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n4 Oil Dri \\nAvoid clutter in your workspace that can act as fall hazards. Keep storage and non- \\nautomotive tools in other areas. Also, clean up tools after you\\x01re finished. \\nProper Lifting Points: A motor vehicle is a 4,000+ pound piece of machinery that could fall on top of you. \\nNever go under a vehicle that is not elevated properly. If the vehicle is  elevated properly \\nthen there should not be any problem. \\nVehicles should only be lifted at their proper lifting points. The proper lifting points on a \\nvehicle are the locations on the vehicle where you place the jack to lift the vehicle and where the jack stands are placed to keep the vehicle elevated. Lifting points are different on every vehicle. The owner\\x01s manual will specify where the lifting points are for your specific vehicle. Often vehicles have lift points marked on the running board or rocker panel. There are a couple of disastrous events that can happen during an attempt to raise a vehicle without using the proper lifting points. The weight of the car pressing down and the jack pressing up can damage the body of the vehicle. Or worse, the jack could tip or slide while a person is underneath the vehicle. \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n5 An illustration which demonstrates vehicle lift points for a sample vehicle; consult the owner\\x01s manual for \\nthe lift points of a specific vehicle. \\nAny vehicle that has a frame can be lifted by the frame. When the front is lifted the jack \\nis usually placed under the suspension cross member. When lifting the rear the jack is placed under the axle if it has a solid axle. If it doesn\\x01t have a solid axle then it should be lifted by the factory recommended lift points. \\nVehicles should always be on firm, level ground. If the ground is not level then the car \\nmay roll and tip the jack. A jack or a jack stand can also slip out or fail to hold the vehicle in an elevated position when the ground is not firm, such as on a dirt road or when there is ice or snow. \\nThere are different types of jacks and jack stands. A jack is used to raise the vehicle \\neither by hydraulic pumping or hand cranking. A jack stand is used to keep the vehicle elevated and has a firm square base. One type of jack that people are most familiar with is the one that is included with the spare tire kit. This is to be used only for changing the \\ntire and it is not sufficient for keeping a vehicle elevated when working under the \\nvehicle. The jack used for changing tires often has a four point rectangular base. This is \\nnot as stable as a square base.  \\nHydraulic jack with hand-pump mechanism \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n6 When minor repairs are being performed, such as changing a tire, it is permissible to \\nraise just one corner of the vehicle, or the front or the rear. The vehicle is first raised \\nwith a jack and then placed on jack stands. (Do not go under the vehicle while it is elevated by a jack). The vehicle should be equally balanced on the jack stands. \\nA mechanic\\x01s shop may have industry jacks or hydraulic lifts. These can be used to \\nraise the vehicle and keep it elevated. These lifts can raise the entire vehicle at the \\nsame time. When lifting the entire vehicle the center of gravity should be positioned evenly with the lifting hoist arms. This is evident when the vehicle is raised and all tires lift off the ground at the same time. Most vehicles are front-heavy due to the engine block. However, many work trucks are balanced to have the center of gravity in the \\nmiddle. \\nHydraulic lift with hoist arms that raise the vehicle on its lifting points. The lift consists of two vertical blue \\nbeams and four white hoist arms. Two white hoist arms on the other side of the vehicle are not seen in \\nthe pictures. \\nImage credit: CC-BY-ANT Berezhnyi on Wikipedia \\nAnother hydraulic lift that raises the car on its tires \\nMore instructions will be given for lifting a corner of the vehicle to replace a spare tire in \\nChapter 4. The owner\\x01s manual should be consulted any time when lifting the vehicle. \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n7 Emergency Preparedness and Response: \\nIn an emergency, preparedness and a quick response can save a life. Although it is \\nrelatively rare, a fire can occur when working on motor vehicles. Some vehicle fluids are flammable. They can combust with excess heat or when a faulty electrical wire creates a spark. Keep a working fire extinguisher in an accessible place. All shop workers \\nshould know where the fire extinguisher is. An ABC or \\x02tri-class\\x03 fire extinguisher is \\nappropriate for auto repair shops. Also, have a plan for an emergency escape if a fire becomes uncontrollable. \\nKeep an emergency response number posted clearly where everyone can see it. \\nKeep a first aid kit handy for minor injuries, like superficial cuts and scratches. \\nHave a flushing station nearby for any vehicle fluid contact with eyes and mouth, or with \\nskin if the fluid is acidic. \\nIntroduction to Tools Used by Mechanics: \\nA commercial mechanic\\x01s shop will usually have industry-standard tools, such as a \\ntorque wrench, hydraulic lifts, pneumatic (air-operated) tools, and electronic devices that \\nconnect with the vehicle\\x01s computer to receive diagnostics. However, a startup repair \\nshop or a highly proficient mechanic at home could get most jobs done with a $200 set of tools if needed. \\nThe most common tools in a mechanic\\x01s set include the following: Flashlight. A flashlight is one of the most-used tools in an auto repair shop. It helps the \\nmechanic see anywhere for visual inspections, maintenance and repairs. \\nFlashlight \\nSocket sets and wrenches. These have two different measurement systems. One is \\nmetric and one SAE (or standard). The metric system has measurements in millimeters (mm). SAE has measurements in inches or fractions of inches (1/4, 5/16, etc.). Wrenches often have an open end and an opposite box end. \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n8 Socket Ratchet Wrench \\nImage credit: CC-BY-SA-Heron2 on Wikipedia \\nWrench set \\nThese wrenches have an open end and a box end \\nImage credit: CC-BY-SA-Ildar Sagdejev on Wikipedia \\nPneumatic (air-powered) wrench \\nImage credit: CC-BY-SA-Bushytails on Wikipedia \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n9 Oil Filter Wrench \\nHas a prying mechanism like other wrenches but one end has a belt that wraps around the object being \\nunscrewed, which is much bigger in diameter than the regular bolts and hex-head screws that other \\nwrenches are used for. \\nImage credit: CC-BY-SA-Three-quarter-ten on Wikipedia \\n4-way lug wrench \\nImage credit: CC-BY-SA-Steffen Heinz Caronna \\nScrewdrivers, both Philips head (the cross-section looks like a cross or plus sign) and \\nflat tipped (or slotted). When using screwdrivers, try to match the size of the screwdriver head with the screw. Also try to avoid stripping the head of the screw (this has occurred when you can firmly turn the screwdriver against the head of the screw continually and the screw never rotates). \\nScrewdriver set \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n10 Screwdriver tips showing Philips (left) and flat or slotted (right) \\nJacks.

But these are the most basic. \\nNow that we\\x01ve reviewed safety rules and gone over the tools used in a mechanic\\x01s \\nshop, you\\x01re ready to continue to the next chapter -- General Maintenance. \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n15 Chapter 2: General Maintenance \\nThis chapter on general maintenance may be one of the most applicable for the \\naverage person to care for his or her own vehicle. We\\x01ll discuss the vehicle owner\\x01s \\nmanual, vehicle fluids, fuses, belts and hoses, vehicle lighting, and the air filter. \\nVehicle Owner\\x01s Manual \\nAll vehicles are different and the owner\\x01s manual for each make and model is the most \\nuseful reference for maintenance and repair of that specific vehicle. Despite the fact that it can often look thick, complicated, and boring on the surface, vehicle owners should become familiar and comfortable with the owner\\x01s manual. They\\x01re not so bad once they\\x01re finally opened. Almost any topic regarding your vehicle\\x01s maintenance can be \\nfound in the index. \\nOwner\\x01s Manual \\nThe owner\\x01s manual will have a maintenance chart. The chart will include such \\ninformation as when to change the oil, rotate tires, replace the air filter, inspect fuel cap and lines, change other fluids (transmission fluid, etc.) and other maintenance issues. Your vehicle may have different maintenance requirements at 30,000 miles, 90,000 miles, 150,000 miles and at other intervals as indicated specifically in your owner\\x01s manual. \\nBeing familiar with the maintenance chart in your owner\\x01s manual can help you save \\nmoney when taking your car to the mechanic for maintenance checks. Sometimes the repair shop will suggest additional services that aren\\x01t necessary. \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n16 If you don\\x01t have the owner\\x01s manual for your car then you may be able to find one \\nonline by using Google or another search engine. Search the website for the make of \\nthe vehicle. You could also try your local library. \\nVehicle Fluids: \\nVehicle fluids include brake fluid, engine oil, coolant, power steering fluid, windshield \\nwasher fluid, transmission fluid and battery fluid. Fluid level information and the location of each fluid reservoir can be found in the owner\\x01s manual for your particular vehicle. (Any images in this chapter are illustrative of one example and your vehicle may look different). \\nBrake Fluid : On most vehicles the reservoir for brake fluid is clear. You can check the \\nfluid without removing the cap. There will be a marking on the reservoir that indicates minimum and maximum level. You\\x01ll want to make sure that the level is between those two marks. This fluid should never need to be topped off during maintenance. Low fluid is an indication of a problem. If the fluid is low then you may want to bring it to a mechanic, depending on your own skill level. Most vehicles have a dashboard light that illuminates when the brake fluid is low. (In Chapter 3 we\\x01ll go over all the dashboard lights, and in Chapter 10 we\\x01ll go over brakes). \\nA brake fluid reservoir. Notice the MAX and MIN markings. \\nImage credit: CC-BY-Frettie on Wikipedia \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n17 Engine Oil . Engine oil should be checked each time the vehicle is refueled (i.e. each \\ntime you go to the gas station). Most engines, but not all, have a dipstick to indicate the \\noil level. Typically the handle is yellow. Follow these steps to check the oil: \\n\\uf0b7Turn the engine off. \\n\\uf0b7Remove the dipstick. \\n\\uf0b7Wipe off the end of the dipstick with a rag or paper towel. \\n\\uf0b7Put the dipstick back in. \\n\\uf0b7Take it out to look at the level at the tip \\nThe stick will have marks on it. The \\x02add\\x03 mark typically indicates one quart low. If an \\nengine is leaking oil then the price of repairs can vary depending on which repair is needed and the make and model of the vehicle. \\nOil dipstick (above) and oil level on a dipstick (below) \\nImage credits: both CC-BY-SA-Dvortygirl on Wikipedia \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n18 Coolant :  Never open the cooling system if the engine is hot . If you\\x01ve just been \\ndriving then don\\x01t open it. After you think the engine has cooled then you can lightly \\ntouch the radiator cap to test it. If it\\x01s still hot, then don\\x01t open it. Opening the radiator cap while the engine is still hot can shoot a six-foot geyser into the air and burn any skin it contacts. The best time to check the coolant is in the morning before the car is driven. \\nCoolant. Notice the green color; coolant can actually be any color (pink, orange, transparent, red, etc.) \\nImage credit: CC-BY-EvelynGiggles on Wikipedia \\nA low coolant level indicates a possible leak which should be investigated. A very small \\namount of evaporation of coolant can occur over time. As a rule, if you need more than \\none quart of coolant, that indicates a problem. \\nIf the coolant is low then it needs to be replenished with the proper type of coolant and \\nmixture. Consult the owner\\x01s manual for the proper type of coolant. The proper mixture is a 50/50 ratio of coolant and distilled water. It is important to use distilled water \\nbecause the impurities in other water would circulate through the system and ruin the \\nsystem over time. Coolant can be purchased pre-mixed in a 50/50 solution if desired. \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n19 50/50 pre-diluted coolant. Image credit: CC-BY-dno1967 on Wikipedia \\nPower Steering Fluid : There may be a clear reservoir for power steering fluid. If there \\nis, then it can be checked the same way as the brake fluid described above. If the \\npower steering fluid is not in a clear reservoir then it will have a dipstick. Refer to the \\nowner\\x01s manual for the location of the reservoir and the type of fluid that should be used. Low power steering fluid is an indication of a leak and it should be investigated. At that point the driver may also notice changes in steering performance. \\nPower steering reservoir (black tank). Notice how the cap is labeled. \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n20 Windshield Washer Fluid . There may be a clear reservoir or a dipstick for windshield \\nwasher fluid. Refer to the owner\\x01s manual for the location. If you live or travel in cold \\nclimates, below 32 degrees, you need to make sure that you use washer fluid with \\nantifreeze. \\nWindshield washer fluid \\nImage credit: CC-BY-SA-Hamedog on Wikipedia \\nTransmission Fluid . Refer to the owner\\x01s manual for the location of the transmission \\nfluid. Some vehicles have a dipstick but many new vehicles do not have one. In some \\nvehicles you have to go underneath the vehicle to check this fluid. If the fluid is low, then there is a leak and it should be investigated. The fluid should also be red. If it is black and/or has a burnt smell then there is a problem with the transmission. \\nNew transmission fluid, red in color \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n21 Battery Fluid and Terminals : If the battery is clear then you can look at the level of the \\nfluid. Most modern vehicles do not have clear batteries. Any corrosion or signs of leaks \\naround the battery are indications of a problem. Corrosion can be a green or white powdery substance. Don\\x01t ever allow corrosion to come in contact with the skin or eyes because this is an acid and it will burn. If corrosion is present at all, the battery may need to be replaced or there could be a problem with the charging system. Excessive \\ndischarging of the battery without the engine running (i.e. listening to the radio, keeping \\nthe cab lights on or using any accessory with the engine off) can cause the battery to overheat, which leads to early battery failure and leakage of battery acid. If the battery fluid is low, only use distilled water to refill it. Never add acid to a battery. \\nThe presence of corrosion indicates a problem that should be addressed. However, as \\na temporary fix, you can clean off the corrosion to get the car started. Start by rinsing off the corrosion with the garden hose. Then disconnect the terminals starting with the negative terminal first, then the positive terminal. Use a mixture of baking soda and water or battery terminal cleaner to rinse off the terminals and battery posts. You\\x01ll see the baking soda reacting with the corrosion to form fizz and bubbles. Use a wire brush or scraper (depending on the type of terminal) to clean the inside of the terminal and battery posts. Then rinse again with more water. Once the terminals and battery posts are clean, reattach the terminals starting with the positive terminal first, then the negative terminal. It is not sufficient just to clean off the corrosion. Again, the presence of corrosion indicates a problem that should be addressed. \\nCar battery \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n22 Fuses \\nConsult the owner\\x01s manual to locate the fuse boxes in your vehicle. They can be \\nanywhere in the vehicle. Modern vehicles use blade type fuses. The part of the fuse that you\\x01ll see initially is plastic and color-coded. When the fuse is removed it can have a \\nsimilar shape to a square letter \\x02C\\x03 with the arms of the \\x02C\\x03 being metal and the back of \\nthe \\x02C\\x03 being the color-coded plastic. The color coding system for fuses has been used since the early 1980s. Older fuses are made of glass tubes. The color coding for modern fuses is universal and indicates the amperage of the fuse. \\nViolet \\x04 3 Amp \\nPink \\x04 4 Amp Orange - 5 Amp Red - 10 Amp Blue - 15 Amp Yellow - 20 Amp Clear - 25 Amp Green - 30 Amp Orange \\x04 40 Amp (and many others) \\nBlade type fuses used in modern vehicles. Most of them have a \\x02C\\x03 shape (or \\x02E\\x03 shape, facing down in \\nthe image). In a blown fuse, the \\x02S\\x03 or upside down \\x02V\\x03s in the middle will be broken (called the element). \\nThe image shows the top view of each fuse just above each side view; notice that each top has metal \\ncontacts that are not covered by colored plastic. \\nImage credit: CC-BY-SA-Havarhen on Wikipedia. \\nGlass tube fuse used in older vehicles \\nImage credit: CC-BY-SA-Aka on Wikipedia \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n23 There are two ways to test the fuse: one is by removing the fuse to look at it and the \\nother is to use a test light. \\nWhen testing it by removing it, simply pull it directly out and look through the color- \\ncoded plastic to see if the element (connection in the center) is intact. If it\\x01s open, then the fuse is burnt out. Sometimes you\\x01ll also see a black singe that makes the \\ntransparent plastic more opaque. Never remove more than one fuse at a time. This \\nhelps to keep track of where the fuse was pulled from and permits easy replacement of the fuse in the correct place. If multiple fuses happen to get pulled at the same time then the size and placement of each fuse can be found in the owner\\x01s manual. \\nAn easier and faster way to test the fuses is with a testing light since the fuses don\\x01t \\nhave to be removed. The testing light looks like an electric screwdriver with a pointed tip. The wire end, or black end of the testing light must be grounded to a clean, unpainted metal surface of the vehicle. If you can\\x01t find a place on the body of the vehicle, then you can always ground it to the negative terminal of the battery. The point of the testing light is placed on the metal contacts of the fuse. There is a metal contact on each side of the fuse\\x01s color-coded plastic (on the back of the \\x02C\\x03). Upon contact the display will indicate if the fuse is still good. \\nTest light \\nNot all fuses have power all the time. So the test should be performed with the key \\nturned to the \\x02on\\x03 position in the ignition and the headlights turned on (the engine does not need to be running). Even with the key and headlights turned on, there is one other fuse that will not have power, which is the crank fuse. The crank fuse only has power when the key is turned to the crank position while starting the engine. This particular fuse does not need to be tested unless the vehicle won\\x01t crank. \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n24 Belts & Hoses \\nTwo hoses and a belt are seen in this image \\nImage credit: CC-BY-SA-Kolossos on Wikipedia \\nIf a belt squeals after starting the engine or while driving then this indicates a problem \\nwith belt tension. Most modern vehicles have automatic belt tensioners which keep the belt at the appropriate tension. Checking the belt tension varies by make and model. Modern vehicles only have one belt, but older vehicles have an individual belt for each accessory of the engine (i.e. power steering, air conditioning, and alternator). Consult a workshop manual for the proper methods for checking belt tension. (The workshop manual or service manual is different from the owner\\x01s manual and may be found at the local public library or ordered online). Belts can also be checked by visual inspection and touch for signs of cracking, fraying, or glazing. Glazing means the drive surface of the belt will be shiny. \\nHoses can be checked visually and by touch for signs of cracking, swelling, or leaks. If \\nthe engine is cool, then squeeze the hose to check for softness. If there is any variation from hose to hose within the same vehicle then that could indicate a problem. \\nA cooling system pressure tester can be a useful tool to pressurize the cooling system \\nand check for leaks or swollen hoses. This tool be rented from an auto parts store and should come with instructions for use. You\\x01ll attach it in place of the radiator cap and hand-pump it as you watch the gauge. Never exceed the indicated pressure that is written on the top of the radiator cap. Most modern cars have a limit of 16 psi. Again, do not open the radiator cap if the engine is still hot. (See also Chapter 6 for more information on the cooling system). \\nVehicle Lighting Vehicle lighting includes instrument panel lighting, warning indicator lights, left and right \\nturn signals, brake lights, hazard lights (which have a distinct circuit from the turn signals even though the display is in the same place), headlights and tail lights, front marker lights, the license plate light, and lights for the cab and trunk. Checking vehicle lighting goes quicker and smoother with two people, and in the case of the brake lights two people are required. \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n25 The instrument lighting is all of the backlighting for the instrument cluster (all the \\ngauges, speedometer, fuel gauge and others). The instrument lighting can be checked \\nby turning on the headlights at night or in a dim garage. Check to see that all the \\ngauges are clearly visible. There should not be any dark spots on the cluster. \\nDashboard showing gauges and warning indicator lights \\nImage credit: CC-BY-SA-Tagaz Vega \\nThe warning indicator lights on the dashboard include the brake light, oil light, check \\nengine light, anti-lock brake (ABS) light, airbag light, tire pressure monitor, engine temperature light, and others -- all of which can be found in the owner\\x01s manual. All of the warning indicator lights will turn on for a set amount of time (about a minute, but varies per vehicle) when you turn the key to the \\x02on\\x03 position without cranking the engine. Once the engine is running, none of these lights should be on (even the seat belt light should be off, indicating that you\\x01re wearing your seat belt). If one is on, then it indicates a problem with its correlating system. The number of lights and types of lights will vary by make and model. Some vehicles have features that others don\\x01t, such as \\ntraction control. (We\\x01ll discuss indicator lights in detail in Chapter 3). \\nExterior lighting is checked with the key turned to the \\x02on\\x03 position in the ignition (or with \\nthe engine running, but it\\x01s not necessary to have the engine running just to check the lights). Turn on the headlights. Check all four corners of the vehicle. On both sides (right \\nand left, or driver side and passenger side) the same number of bulbs should be \\nilluminated. There should be two front marker lights that are orange, two tail lights, and a license plate light. \\nRear lights of a vehicle with the brake lights illuminated. \\nImage credit: CC-BY-SA-Paultantk on Wikipedia \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n26 Turn the left turn signal on. Check the left front and left rear of the vehicle for blinking \\nlights. Some vehicles have more than one bulb for the turn signal and some even \\ninclude a signal in the side rearview mirrors. Be sure every applicable bulb is \\nilluminating. Some vehicles have a cornering lamp, which is a clear lamp on the front of the vehicle which illuminates corners while turning. This should be illuminated but it will not blink. \\nTurn the right turn signal on. Check the right front and right rear of the vehicle for \\nblinking lights. Be sure all applicable bulbs are illuminating. Check the cornering lamp if applicable. \\nWhen the turn signal is on and the indicator is blinking fast or not blinking at all, these \\nare indicators of a failed bulb. \\nBrake lights require two people for inspection. One person presses the brake pedal \\nwhile the other person checks the rear of the vehicle to make sure all the brake lights are illuminating, including the high mount brake light in the rear window if the vehicle is equipped with one. \\nActivate the hazard switch. Check to make sure that there are flashing lights with an \\nequal number of bulbs on all four corners. The hazard lights are wired separately from the turn signals, so it is important to check the hazard lights even if the turn signals have been checked. \\nAir Filter Consult the owner\\x01s manual for the location of the air filter. Remove the air filter. Inspect \\nfor visual signs of dirt and debris. Hold the filter up to a fluorescent light; you should be able to see light coming through the filter. If there is any doubt then change it. It\\x01s cheap preventative maintenance and it helps preserve fuel economy. (The air filter is discussed more in Chapter 7). \\nVarious air filters. \\nImage credit: CC-BY-SA- Maly LOLek on Wikipedia \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n27 Chapter 3: Dashboard Indicator Lights \\nThe instrument panel on your dashboard has multiple gauges and indicators. These \\nmay include the fuel gauge, speedometer, tachometer, oil pressure, and engine \\ntemperature. Most are self-explanatory-- the speedometer measures your speed, etc. \\nThe one that may not be self-explanatory is the tachometer, which indicates engine speed in revolutions per minute (RPM). It often has a red zone which you should never exceed. \\nIn the previous chapter we checked all the vehicle lighting which included the \\ndashboard symbols. Now we\\x01ll discuss what these symbols mean. As always, a better resource to learn the meaning of each dashboard symbol for a specific vehicle is the owner\\x01s manual for that vehicle. The ones that are included in each vehicle will vary by \\nmake and model. \\nDashboard lights can be red, orange (or yellow) and blue. Generally when a red light \\ncomes on while driving, it means you should immediately pull over safely and call a tow truck. However there are some exceptions \\x04 some lights which are generally red can be yellow or orange, and some red lights can be fixed immediately (seat belt light \\x04 put your seat belt on, door ajar light \\x04 close all the doors). Orange or yellow lights generally indicate that there is a problem with your vehicle, but it is safe to drive to a repair facility or your home residence to investigate further. This also has some exceptions. It is always best to consult the owner\\x01s manual for a particular vehicle. \\nThe following are the general symbols: \\nAirbag Light or Supplemental Restraint Warning Light: Red, Orange or Yellow. \\nWhenever this light illuminates the air bag system senses a problem, which could be a safety issue. It doesn\\x01t necessarily mean that the airbags will not work. The airbags \\nmight or might not still deploy during an accident . The light means that there is a part  of \\nthe airbag system that may not work. \\nAnti-Lock Brakes Light: Orange or yellow light. This indicates a failure in the anti-lock \\nbrake (ABS) system and anti-lock brakes are disabled. The purpose of the ABS is to allow steering control of a vehicle while braking and to avoid skidding during a panic stop. If this light is on, then normal conventional brake function will continue. If it\\x01s on in the event of a panic stop then the vehicle will skid. Have the vehicle serviced. \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n28 Brake Light: Red light, immediately pull over safely and have the vehicle towed (or \\ndisengage the parking brake if applicable). This light indicates that there is something \\nwrong with the brakes. There could be a low brake fluid level, there could be a hydraulic brake failure, or the parking brake is engaged. \\nChange Oil Soon. Orange or yellow light. This light indicates that routine oil change and \\nmaintenance is due. It\\x01s based on revolutions of the crankshaft, which is even more accurate than basing routine oil changes on mileage. \\nCheck Engine Light: Red or yellow light. There is a problem with the vehicle emissions \\nand the vehicle\\x01s computer will have diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) which will be retrieved when the vehicle is inspected. The light may come on and then off. If there are any performance issues with the way the vehicle is driving, then pull over and have it towed. If the light comes on and stays on, or comes on and then flashes during acceleration, then immediately pull over safely and have it towed to a shop. Don\\x01t \\nconfuse the check engine light with the \\x02service vehicle  soon\\x03 light below. \\nDoor Ajar Indicator Light: Red light. One of the vehicle doors is open. Close the open \\ndoor before proceeding to drive. There may also be a separate light for the trunk. \\nGlowplug Indicator Light: This light is only seen in vehicles with diesel engines. The \\nglow plug is a device that is used to help get the diesel engine started. \\nHigh Beam Indicator or Brights. Usually blue, but can be red on older vehicles. This \\nindicates that your brights are on. \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n29 Low Coolant Level Light: Red, Orange or yellow light. This light indicates that the engine \\ncoolant level is low, which could be due to a leak. It is still safe to drive as long as the \\nengine temperature light is not on. In some vehicles the first symbol above, the \\nthermometer symbol, can also be a temperature light. (Remember from Chapter 2 that the coolant level should not be checked while the engine is hot). Some vehicles can have a blue thermometer symbol. Consult the owner\\x01s manual for its description. \\nLow Fuel Light: Yellow or Orange. This light indicates that fuel is low. It could also be a \\nsimple round light that illuminates when the fuel gauge is nearing empty. \\nLow Oil Level Light: Yellow or Orange. The oil level is low. Refill the oil as soon as \\npossible and bring the vehicle to a shop to see why it was low. \\nLow Oil Pressure or Engine Oil Pressure Light: Red light (immediately pull over safely). \\nOnce you pull over you could check your oil level and add oil if it\\x01s low. If the light continues illuminated then you should have your vehicle towed to a facility. Catastrophic engine failure will occur if the oil pressure is low. Repairs for these damages can be \\nvery expensive. \\nParking Brake Light: Red light. The parking brake is engaged or not fully released. \\nRelease it completely before driving. \\nService Vehicle Soon: Yellow light. This light may be used in conjunction with other \\nlights. Depending on which other lights are illuminated, there may be a problem with the anti-lock brakes (ABS), brake hydraulic system, traction control system (TCS), or the \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n30 electronic suspension system. Don\\x01t confuse with the \\x02Service Engine  Soon\\x03 light, which \\nis one of the possible check engine lights shown above. \\nTemperature Light (or Hot Light). Red light  (immediately pull over safely, turn off the \\nengine, and have it towed). This light means engine temperature has exceeded maximum parameters. Severe engine failure will result if you continue to drive. For a few extra moments while you\\x01re finding a safe place to pull over, you can turn on the \\nheater to high, which dissipates heat from the engine. If the heater does not work, it is \\nan indication that the coolant level is low, and that the vehicle should not be driven. The dashboard may also have a temperature gauge which has a thermometer symbol. \\nThrottle Control Warning Light: Yellow or orange. In some vehicles the throttle has an \\nelectronic control system. These lights indicate that there is a problem with the system. Have the vehicle serviced as soon as possible. In some makes and models the wrench light can be for other purposes. Be sure to consult the owner\\x01s manual. \\nTire Pressure Warning Light: Yellow or orange. This light indicates that one or more of \\nthe tires has fallen below 25% of the recommended pressure. Have the tires checked soon. \\nTurn Signals and Hazard Light Display: These will only illuminate when a turn signal \\n(left or right) or the hazard lights (both simultaneously) are turned on. If one stays on instead of blinking in rhythm or blinks slower or quicker than usual then there is a problem. One of the bulbs may need to be replaced or there is something wrong with the circuit. \\nVoltage Light. Red Light (pull over safely and get it towed). If this particular light \\nilluminates while you\\x01re on the freeway then you may be able to proceed to the next \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n31 exit. This light indicates that voltage is below the minimum specification and your \\nvehicle will stop running once the battery dies. Safely pulling over and having the \\nvehicle towed is even more important at night since you\\x01ll lose the use of your \\nheadlights, which tend to drain the battery even quicker. Some of the samples are yellow; in this case you should still treat it as a red light. \\nSecurity Light. Red, Orange or Yellow. This indicates that there is a problem in the theft \\ndeterrent system. Sometimes the vehicle will not run if this light illuminates or blinks. \\nSeat Belt Light. Red light. This means that the driver and/or passenger do not have their \\nseat belts fastened. Put on your seatbelts before continuing to drive. There is a reason why they show videos of people in car accidents to Driver\\x01s Ed students. They want you to understand that when you get behind the wheel you\\x01re potentially putting people in danger. Ideally, seat belts would be more like the harnesses used in roller coasters, which include two shoulder straps and a middle fastening device at the chest. The cross-over shoulder strap isn\\x01t very effective in comparison. It is designed that way for commercial purposes and to account for common human behavior. It\\x01s easier and \\nquicker to have one buckle where the belt can be pulled over and fastened in one quick \\nmotion while the person is just getting into the car. While the conventional seat belt isn\\x01t 100% efficient, it is potentially the most important safety feature of the vehicle because it keeps the body harnessed and kept in the seat. Wear your seat belt! \\nTraction Control Light or Low Track Light: Yellow, orange or blue light. This indicates \\ndrive wheel speed is higher than the coasting wheel speed. For example, if you have front wheel drive, then the front wheel speed is higher than the rear wheel speed. This can be useful on ice, dirt or any low-traction condition. Be careful while driving in these conditions, especially when turning. \\nOnce again, this is just a sample list. Your particular make and model could have other \\nlights and/or it won\\x01t include all the lights listed above. Consult the owner\\x01s manual. \\nMore detailed information on warning indicator lights can be found at http://repairpal.com/warning-lights- \\nchart . Most of the images/symbols in this chapter were taken from this web page and are believed to be \\nin the public domain due to the universality of these symbols. Some were taken from \\nhttp://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Dashboard_icons  and other pages of Wikipedia. \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n32 Chapter 4: Tires \\nThis chapter is all about tires. There may be more to these rubber doughnuts than many \\npeople realize. In this chapter we\\x01ll discuss tire specifications, how to check tire pressure, wheel alignment, the wear bar, how to change a tire, and old tire disposal. \\nTire Specifications \\nThere are two specification sets for tires including the tire manufacturer specifications \\nand the vehicle manufacturer specifications. Whenever you take your car to a tire shop \\nto get the tires changed, they have to meet these specifications by law. You can get a \\ntire that goes above these specifications, but never below. \\nThe vehicle manufacturer\\x01s specifications include speed rating, load and size. It is \\nlocated on a sticker in the driver\\x01s door jamb of the vehicle and in the vehicle owner\\x01s manual. When buying a new tire you\\x01ll want to stick with a tire that meets the manufacturer\\x01s specifications because that\\x01s the kind of tire that the vehicle was built to use. \\nVehicle Manufacturer specifications in the driver\\x01s door jamb of a vehicle. This indicates that the tires for \\nthis vehicle should be inflated to 30 PSI, except the spare which is 60 PSI. \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n33 The tire manufacturer specifications include the tire size, load, pressure, temperature, \\nspeed rating and tread wear. The tire manufacturer specifications indicate what the tire is made to withstand. These specifications can be found on the wall of the tire itself. \\nTire manufacturer specifications on the tire wall which include various tire codes. \\nImage credit: CC-BY-Flanker on Wikipedia \\nUnless you become a tire technician, you don\\x01t have to know all the numbers on the tire \\nor on the sticker/owner\\x01s manual because every time you get your tires replaced, the tire shop will make sure you at least have a tire that meets the required specifications. \\nProbably the most important number for the common person to recognize is the \\nrecommended tire pressure on the vehicle manufacturer\\x01s specifications on the driver\\x01s door jamb sticker. (The tire manufacturer\\x01s specifications on the tire itself include the maximum pressure that the tire can have, yet the maximum pressure isn\\x01t necessarily the best pressure for the vehicle). \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n34 How to Check the Tire Pressure \\nIn order to check tire pressure you\\x01ll need a tire pressure gauge. Gauges can be \\npurchased at auto parts stores and service stations (sometimes a little as $1, but could be $3-$7). They\\x01re usually about the size of a large pen, but can come in other forms. Sometimes a gauge is included with the air hose of the air dispensing stand at the gas station. \\nPen-sized tire pressure gauge \\nAir dispensing hose at a gas station with built-in pressure gauge \\nRound tire pressure gauge and hose \\nFollow these steps to check and correct the tire pressure: \\n\\uf0b7Remove the valve cap of each tire \\n\\uf0b7Align the gauge up to the valve \\n\\uf0b7Press the gauge onto the valve with firm direct pressure and then release. You\\x01ll \\nsee the measuring stick get pushed out of the other side of the gauge (on a pen gauge). \\n\\uf0b7Fill the tire with air, recheck the pressure, then repeat as needed until the desired \\npressure is obtained. \\n\\uf0b7Replace the valve cap \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n35 Tire pressure is measured in PSI (pounds per square inch) or KPA (Kilopascals) which \\nare simply units of measurement for pressure. (Pressure is a force distributed over \\nsurface area) \\nChecking the tire pressure \\nWheel Alignment \\nTires can wear rapidly if they are not aligned properly, or the vehicle can pull to one side \\nwhile driving. There are three angle measurements that are used in tire alignment: camber, toe, and caster. Knowing these angles is necessary for any tire technician. In addition, knowing these angles can be helpful for anyone trying to communicate with tire \\ntechnicians. \\nIn order to understand these angles one must consider the planes of the vehicle, which \\nare ways of dividing the vehicle in each of its three dimensions (length, width and height). The horizontal plane, often depicted in math as the X plane, divides the vehicle \\ninto top and bottom parts. The vertical plane, often depicted in math as the Y plane, \\ndivides the vehicle into right and left parts (or driver\\x01s side and passenger side). A second vertical plane which intersects the first vertical plane at 90 degrees is often depicted in math as the Z plane, and it divides the vehicle into front and rear parts. \\nThese three images show a model of a vehicle from the front, side and top views and the three \\ndimensional planes that are used to describe tire alignment angles. \\nImages by Rex Kimball, www.MirexMarketing.com \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n36 The camber angle  lies on the Z plane. (Imagine looking at the tires from the front of the \\nvehicle). A camber angle of zero is when the wheel is vertical. If there is any camber, \\nthen the wheel is deviating from the vertical plane, or the Y plane. In many vehicles the camber should be zero, but some may deviate by 2-3 degrees. \\nImage shows an outward camber. Notice how a tire in this alignment would wear quicker on the outside. If \\nit had an inward camber then it would wear more on the inside of the tire \\nImage by Rex Kimball, www.MirexMarketing.com \\nA wheelchair with an inward camber as seen on many athletic wheelchairs. \\nThe toe angle  lies on the X plane and deviates from the Y and Z planes. (Imagine the \\nvehicle from a bird\\x01s eye view or a top view). A toe angle of zero is when the wheels are \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n37 parallel on the Z and Y planes. This isn\\x01t quite how the wheels should be, at least not \\nthe front wheels. When thinking of toe, consider either the front wheels as a pair or the \\nrear wheels as a pair. The distance between the front of each pair of wheels is \\nmeasured and the rear of each pair (i.e. the distance between the front of the front wheels and the rear of the front wheels when considering the pair of front wheels). When the front wheels are properly aligned the front of the front wheels will actually be slightly closer together than the back of the front wheels, meaning the front wheels \\nshould have a slight inward toe. When the rear wheels are properly aligned they will be \\nparallel (i.e. the distance between the front of the rear wheels is the same as the distance between the rear of the rear wheels). \\nImage shows an inward toe of the front passenger tire. \\nImage by Rex Kimball, www.MirexMarketing.com \\nMeasuring the distance between the front and back of the front tires as a pair and the rear tires as a pair. \\nIn this illustration, line a is shorter than line b, indicating an inward toe of one or both tires (both in this \\nimage). Lines c and d are equal in length, indicating a toe angle of zero. \\nImage by Rex Kimball, www.MirexMarketing.com \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n38 If a right wheel is turned inward while the left wheel is straight, or if both wheels are \\nturned too far inward, or both are turned outward, etc., then there is an abnormal toe \\nangle present and the wheels are not aligned. (Technically when you steer the vehicle \\nand the front wheels turn to the left or right, they are deviating from the Y and Z planes, but they stay parallel to each other with only a slight variation to account for the fact that one wheel is on the outside and one is on the inside while turning). \\nThe caster angle  is an angle which lies on the Y plane and deviates from the Z plane. \\n(Imagine looking at the vehicle from the side). Most devices with steering capability do \\nnot have a caster angle of zero. When the deviation is towards the rear, the caster is considered positive. When the deviation is towards the front, the caster is considered negative. On motor vehicles the caster is usually positive, (the higher ball joint will be \\ncloser to the rear than the lower ball joint). This helps the vehicle to drive straight even \\nwhen the steering wheel is hands-free. Since the view of the caster is blocked by the wheel on vehicles with four wheels, it is most easily visible on motorcycles and bicycles. Think of the two braces that come down on both sides of the front wheel. Notice how the handlebars are closer to the rear than the center point (fulcrum) of the front wheel. This is a clearly visible positive caster. The front wheels of shopping carts have a negative caster. The physics of a negative caster allows for the front wheels to turn counter clockwise as the cart is turning clockwise so that the cart is easier to maneuver throughout the store. \\nImage shows a positive caster. Motor vehicles have positive casters which help the vehicle drive straight \\neven with a hands-free steering wheel. \\nImage by Rex Kimball, www.MirexMarketing.com \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n39 A positive caster is easily seen on the front wheels of motorcycles and bicycles. \\nImage adapted, original credit: CC-BY-SA-Yesterdays Antique Motorcycles on Wikipedia \\nNegative caster on a cart \\nImage adapted, original credit: CC-BY-SA-DMahlko on Wikipedia \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n40 Wear Bar \\nThe wear bar is a horizontal bar molded into the tire between the treads. The wear bar \\nindicates safe tread depth. It is usually about 1/16 of an inch measured from the valley of the tread, but not as high as the tread itself when the tire is new. As the tread wears down, the wear bar becomes more visible. When the tread is even with the wear bar the \\ntires should be changed. Tires should be rotated with each oil change and kept in \\nalignment to ensure even tread wear. \\nTire with arrows pointing to the wear bars between the treads. \\nHow to Change a Tire \\nKnowing how to change a tire is mostly helpful in case you get a flat while driving on the \\nroad. Every other time your tires get removed, rotated and/or replaced it will be by a tire technician. \\nEvery vehicle has instructions for using the jack and other tools as necessary to change \\nthe tire. Some of the details can vary by make and model, such as the storage location for the jack and spare tire. Consult the owner\\x01s manual of the vehicle. Also, there will often be a sticker with instructions located with the jack and spare tire. \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n41 Standard spare tire kit with spare tire, lug wrench, and tire jack. This particular kit does not include chocks \\nfor the other tires. Notice how the spare tire is smaller than the regular tire. It is only meant to be used to \\nget the vehicle to a repair shop. \\nImage credit: CC-BY-Kurt Nordstrom \\nHere are some general guidelines for changing a tire (in order): \\n\\uf0b7Make sure the vehicle is on level ground (see Chapter 1, Safety, proper lifting \\n points) \\n\\uf0b7Apply the parking brake \\n\\uf0b7Remove the spare tire and tools from the vehicle \\n\\uf0b7Use wheel chocks to block the wheels opposite of the wheel you\\x01re changing (i.e. \\nif you\\x01re changing a rear tire, then put the ch ocks in front of the front wheels).  \\noWheel chocks are similar to triangle-shaped door stoppers.

It occurs in 4 repeating steps or cycles: \\n\\uf0b7Intake \\n\\uf0b7Compression \\n\\uf0b7Combustion (or power) \\n\\uf0b7Exhaust \\nThe fuel and air are drawn into the engine cylinder by the piston moving down while the \\nintake valve is open. When the piston starts moving up, both intake and exhaust valves are closed. The piston moving up compresses the air and fuel mixture. The air and fuel mixture is then ignited with a spark plug (in regular gasoline engines), creating combustion. The extreme heat creates high pressure forcing the piston down. Next, the exhaust valve opens. The piston goes back up exhausting the exhaust gas. Then the cycle is repeated. \\nC: Crankshaft \\nE: Exhaust camshaft I: Inlet camshaft P: Piston R: Connecting rod S: Spark plug \\nV: Valves (Red: exhaust, Blue: intake) \\nW: Cooling water duct \\nCross section of a cylinder in a combustion engine. \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n44 Here is a decent animation of the Otto cycle on YouTube: \\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qHherIwsTE . (In the illustration above, the intake is \\non the right and the exhaust is on the left, but in the YouTube animation the intake is on \\nthe left and the exhaust is on the right) \\nThe process of combustion is the conversion of chemical energy (gasoline) into heat \\nenergy (combustion) which is converted into reciprocating energy (pumping of the pistons). The pistons turn a crank shaft via a connecting rod. As the piston goes up and down during combustion it rotates the crankshaft. The crankshaft turns reciprocating energy into rotational energy. This energy is eventually transferred to the wheels \\nthrough the drivetrain, which we will discuss later in Chapter 9. \\nAn illustration showing pistons (gray) in their respective cylinders (blue) and a crankshaft (red). As the \\npistons go up and down the crankshaft is rotated. This image is animated at \\nhttp://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cshaft.gif \\nIn a diesel engine there are no spark plugs. The fuel is ignited based on compression \\nalone. The compression is higher on a diesel engine, which generates enough heat to cause the combustion. \\nA hybrid vehicle uses an electric motor and battery for assisting propulsion along with \\nthe internal combustion engine. The internal combustion engine generates electricity to recharge the batteries. Also, the batteries are recharged when braking to a stop. \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n45 Engine Oil \\nSample of motor oil \\nThe purpose of engine oil is to form a film of lubrication between all moving parts of an \\ninternal combustion engine to reduce friction and wear. Choosing the right engine oil for your vehicle and changing the oil during regularly-scheduled maintenance intervals will keep the engine running smoothly over time. The recommended oil type and specification for your vehicle can be found in the owner's manual. Another place to find it is on the oil fill cap. It will be based on the ambient temperature where you live. There are two engine oil codes that the owner\\x01s manual will specify, an API and an SAE. \\nAll oil has an API code which stands for American Petroleum Institute. It's a service \\nrating for the quality, cleanliness, and types of detergents in the oil. The code will always be two letters. \\nThe SAE is the viscosity or thickness of the oil. Modern oil is multi-viscosity oil. The SAE \\nmay be something to the effect of 5W-30. The first number-letter combo (5W) indicates the viscosity or thickness of the oil when it is cold. The second number is the viscosity at the engine operating temperature. Before they had multi-viscosity oil there was only single-viscosity oil (such as SAE 30), which in cold weather was extremely thick. Trying to pour it into your engine would be like pouring honey, but more importantly it would be hard to pump the oil and lubricate the engine. That's why older engines had to be warmed up before you could drive them. \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n46 Chapter 6: The Cooling System \\nThis chapter is about the cooling system for the engine, not the air conditioning used to \\ncool passengers while driving. A cooling system is needed to dissipate excess heat \\ncreated during the internal combustion process. \\nCooling system maintenance is preventive maintenance done to avoid an overheating \\nsituation and to avoid electrolysis (the breakdown of metals that occurs inside the \\nengine block). Cooling system maintenance mileage varies by make and model. In \\nsome cases, maintenance is necessary before the mileage indicated in the owner's manual. For example, if the manufacturer recommendation is a coolant flush at 150,000 miles, it could easily need to be flushed before that. If the coolant is low then there may be a leak. Leaks can occur at the water pump, heater core, the hoses, radiator, and at \\nmultiple locations throughout the engine. \\nThe coolant is inspected at every oil change (about every 5,000 miles) and when it is \\nfound to be dirty then a cooling system flush is necessary. Typically the coolant gets dirty when non-distilled water is mixed with it. The impurities in the water cause corrosion (breakdown of the metals in the engine), which collect with coolant. This can clog radiator and cooling passages. That is why coolant is mixed with distilled water where these impurities are absent. \\nWhen checking the coolant at home, be sure to never open the radiator while the \\nengine is hot. (Remember Chapter 2: Checking Fluids). \\nHow to flush the cooling system: \\n\\uf0b7Refer to the owner\\x01s manual for locations of each part of the cooling system \\n\\uf0b7Open the radiator drain to drain the cooling system and collect the drainage into \\na container (you can take this to your local auto parts store for recycling) \\n\\uf0b7Remove the thermostat. The thermostat is typically on the engine side of the \\nupper radiator hose, but in some cases it\\x01s on the lower hose. \\n\\uf0b7Disconnect the lower radiator hose, force coolant through the thermostat housing \\n(upper hose and engine block) with a garden hose until the water runs clear \\n\\uf0b7Connect the garden hose to the radiator, flush water through the radiator until the \\nwater runs clear. \\n\\uf0b7Completely drain the cooling system of all the water. \\n\\uf0b7Reinstall the thermostat \\n\\uf0b7Disconnect the reservoir and flush with the garden hose until water runs clear. \\nCompletely drain the reservoir. \\n\\uf0b7Connect the hoses and close the drains. \\n\\uf0b7Fill the cooling system with new coolant to manufacturer's specification and \\ndistilled water. Use a 50/50 mixture of coolant and distilled water or pre-mixed coolant. \\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n47 Flushing the cooling system will not correct an overheating concern. If your vehicle is \\noverheating, (as indicated on the temperature gauge on the dash), it would need to be \\ndiagnosed and repaired. \\nAny time you open the cooling system and put it back together you want to pressure \\ntest the cooling system to check for any leaks. You can use a pressure tester which can be rented from an auto parts store. It will come with instructions. Generally, it attaches \\nto the radiator where the radiator cap goes, and you pump it by hand until the pressure \\non the gauge matches the pressure that is written on top of the radiator cap. Typically on a modern vehicle this pressure is between 13 - 16 psi. Let the vehicle sit with this pressure for 20 - 30 minutes. Then inspect the entire cooling system for any leaks and check the gauge for a change in pressure. If there is less pressure than before then \\nthere is probably a leak. \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n48 Pressure testing the cooling system \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n49 Chapter 7: The Fuel System \\nThis chapter is about the fuel system. The fuel system is the system which pumps fuel \\ninto the cylinders of the internal combustion engine and mixes it with the perfect amount of air for combustion. There are two types of fuel systems: fuel injection and carburetors. \\nIllustration of a carburetor. \\nImage credit: CC-BY-SA-WikipedianProlific on Wikipedia \\nPrior to 1985 most vehicles used a carburetor. A carburetor uses a venturi (narrowed \\npassage within the carburetor) to draw fuel from a float bowl based strictly on the \\nvolume of air flowing through the carburetor. A carburetor is a primitive method of mixing air and fuel. It is far less efficient than modern fuel injection. That\\x01s why all modern cars today are built with fuel injection. \\nHow a Fuel Injection System Works: Fuel injection is a complex electrical circuit using multiple sensors as inputs to a PCM \\n(powertrain control module, also called the computer). The PCM then interprets the inputs from these sensors and produces a PWM (pulse width modulated) signal. A PWM signal is a digital on/off signal. This translates into how much fuel is injected into the engine. \\nThe PCM then receives feedback signals from oxygen sensors. An oxygen sensor is a \\nsensor that checks the air-fuel ratio by monitoring exhaust gas at or near the exhaust \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n50 manifolds (review Chapter 5 if needed). Using this information, the PCM can adjust fuel \\ntrim accordingly to keep the engine running clean, long and efficient. This is one of the \\nmain reasons newer automobiles last so much longer, burn less fuel, and have cleaner emissions. \\nIllustration of a fuel injector. \\nImage credit: CC-BY-SA-WikipedianProlific on Wikipedia \\nFuel Filter and Air Filter: \\nThere are two filters which protect the fuel system and engine: the fuel filter and the air \\nfilter. The fuel system is very sensitive to contamination and debris. A small amount of contamination can cause severe problems in any fuel system. Therefore, these filters are critical for protecting the fuel system and engine. \\nA fuel filter (white) next to the air filter compartment (circular black part) \\nImage credit: CC-BY-Phasmatisnox on Wikipedia \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n51 When you fill your vehicle with fuel from a gas station, the fuel will have contaminants. \\nBetween the fuel tank and the engine the fuel passes through a sock filter which \\nprevents large contaminants from passing through. Then the fuel will pass through the fuel filter which prevents small contaminants from passing. Anything that passes through the fuel filter can pass through the rest of the fuel system. Refer to the owner\\x01s manual to find the manufacturer's recommendation for the mileage at which the fuel \\nfilter should be changed. \\nAn air filter protects the engine from dust and dirt entering the combustion chamber \\nthrough the air intake system. Any dirt in the engine can cause engine wear and eventually lead to engine failure. Therefore, an air filter, like the fuel filter, is also a \\ncritical component in any internal combustion engine. The air filter is inspected with \\nevery oil change and it is changed as needed. (The air filter was also mentioned in Chapter 2 since checking it is part of general maintenance).  \\nVarious air filters. \\nImage credit: CC-BY-SA- Maly LOLek on Wikipedia \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n52 Chapter 8: The Electrical System \\nThis chapter is about the electrical system of the vehicle. The main parts of the \\nelectrical system are the battery, alternator, and ignition system. The battery is the \\npower source of the whole vehicle. The alternator is a re-charging device which is used to maintain the charge of the battery. The ignition system is used to ignite the fuel at the correct time during the Otto cycle of events (review Chapter 5 for the Otto cycle of events). \\nAlternator \\nImage credit: CC-BY-SA-Lolossos on Wikipedia Car Battery \\nIgnition System (prior to 1975) \\nImage credit: CC-BY-SA-Allumage_batterie on Wikipedia \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n53 The \\x02ignition\\x03 in this lesson is not the same as the key ignition; it\\x01s about the ignition \\nsystem that is used in the engine to ignite the air-fuel mixture in the combustion \\nchamber. Prior to 1975, the ignition system consisted of the ignition coil, capacitor, \\ncontact breaker, distributor and spark plugs. The ignition coil converts low voltage electricity into high voltage. The high voltage electricity is sent to the distributor through the rotor, then it transmits out the distributor cap through plug wires to the spark plugs. The contact breaker or contact points complete and interrupt the circuit to the ignition \\ncoil on the low voltage side. The capacitor absorbs a voltage spike when the points \\nopen to avoid burning the contacts of the points. \\nIn a modern vehicle the ignition system consists of a crankshaft position sensor, which \\nsends a signal to the PCM (powertrain control module or computer). The PCM interprets \\nthe signal and sends a signal to the ignition coils on each cylinder. Then the ignition \\ncoils fire through the spark plugs. Some vehicles will use one coil for two cylinders, and some have a separate coil for each cylinder. When one coil is used for two cylinders, the spark plugs for both cylinders fire at the same time, but one of the cylinders will be in the exhaust step of the Otto cycle, so it\\x01s kind of a waste spark (not used to ignite fuel). \\nThe ignition system works in conjunction with fuel injection (Chapter 7) so that the \\ncorrect Otto Cycle of events occurs in the cylinders. The cylinders of internal combustion engines are numbered and the firing sequence occurs in a specific order. The firing order can vary by vehicle make and model. The engine size is also a factor. \\nFor example, in an 8 cylinder Chevy engine the cylinders might be numbered 1, 3, 5, 7 \\non the driver\\x01s side (or left side of the engine from the driver\\x01s perspective), and 2, 4, 6, 8 on the passenger side. The firing order for this particular engine would be 1, 8, 4, 3, 6, 5, 7, 2. \\nIllustration of numbered cylinders of a V8 engine; the driver\\x01s side is the right side of this image since the \\nfront of the engine is towards the bottom of the image. \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n54 Spark Plug Gap: \\nThe purpose of the spark plug gap is to create an electric arc or spark of high heat to \\nignite the air-fuel mixture in the combustion chamber at the correct time. If the gap is too small then the spark is not hot enough to ignite the fuel. If the gap is too wide, then the voltage is not high enough to create a spark. Either condition can create an ignition misfire, causing poor performance and high emissions. \\nHow to Safely Jump Start a Vehicle with a Failed Battery: When a battery loses its charge the vehicle won\\x01t start and it becomes necessary to use \\nanother vehicle for a jump start. Since jump starting a failed battery with a charged \\nbattery involves creating an electrical circuit, it is important to follow the right steps to \\nperform a jump start safely: \\n\\uf0b7Do your best to line up the vehicles so that the two batteries are close enough to \\nconnect jumper cables. \\n\\uf0b7Turn off the active vehicle \\n\\uf0b7Verify there is no odor (like sulfur) coming from either battery. If there is a sulfur \\nodor do not attempt to jump start the vehicle. The battery could explode due to the gas that is released (hydrogen gas). \\n\\uf0b7The next steps involve connecting the cables. When connecting cables to the \\nfirst vehicle, which is the dead vehicle, make sure the other ends of the cables are not touching each other.  \\n\\uf0b7First connect the red cable to the positive (red) battery terminal on the dead \\nbattery or to the jump start locations specified in the owner\\x01s manual. \\n\\uf0b7Connect the black cable to the negative terminal of the dead battery or to the \\njump start locations specified in the owner\\x01s manual. \\n\\uf0b7Connect the positive (red) cable to the positive terminal of the working vehicle (or \\nto the specified jump start location in the owner\\x01s manual of the working vehicle). \\n\\uf0b7Connect the negative (black) cable to the negative terminal of the working vehicle \\n(or to the specified jump start location in the owner\\x01s manual of the working vehicle) or to anything metal. The metal must be bare or without any paint that would inhibit conduction of electricity. The engine block is sufficient. Yet, the negative terminal is often the most accessible.  \\no(More briefly the order is: dead red, dead black, live red, then live black. \\nRed is always positive, black is always negative.) \\n\\uf0b7Start the working vehicle and allow it to run for approximately 5 minutes. \\n\\uf0b7Attempt to start the other vehicle. If the vehicle fails to start, there may be \\nadditional problems or the battery is no longer rechargeable. \\n\\uf0b7Take off the cables in reverse order (always remove negative first) and make \\nsure the cables don\\x01t touch each other as you\\x01re removing them \\noRemove the negative cable from the jumped vehicle  \\noRemove the positive cable from the jumped vehicle (make sure they don\\x01t \\ntouch each other) \\noRemove the negative cable from the previously working vehicle \\noRemove the positive cable from the previously working vehicle. \\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n55 That may seem like a lot of steps above to memorize, so here are some tricks to \\nremember the process:  first connect the Dead Red, Fred . This phrase will help you \\nremember that when connecting the cables you\\x01ll start with the positive cable on the \\ndead battery. The order is dead red, dead black, live red, live black. Then it\\x01s the \\nreverse order to remove the cables after the dead battery is jumped: First remove the \\nJumped Black, Jack . Remove the jumped black, jumped red, then the previously live \\nblack, then the previously live red. \\nNever attempt to jump start a diesel vehicle. Since a diesel engine battery requires \\nmuch more power, attempting to jump start it could damage the running vehicle. \\nTypically you can attempt to jump start a hybrid car, but if the high power battery is \\ndead, the vehicle will not start. However, a hybrid can be used to jump start a regular gasoline vehicle. \\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n56 Chapter 9: The Drive Train \\nThe drive train (drivetrain or powertrain) is a series of parts that transfer energy from the \\ncombustion engine to the wheels. If needed, review Chapter 5 to recall how the internal combustion engine works to convert chemical energy to rotational energy. The drive train has three main parts: the transmission, drive line or drive shaft, and differential. In \\nsome four-wheel drive vehicles a transfer case is also necessary. \\nPowertrain for a Subaru vehicle. The engine and transmission are seen on the right. The drive shaft is in \\nthe middle and the differential is on the left at the center of the rear axle. \\nThe rotation of the crankshaft in the internal combustion engine does not equal the \\nrotation of the wheels. Just like a bicycle, motor vehicles have gears. The lower gears are used for lower speeds, while the higher gears are used for higher speeds. Yet, the RPM which is read on the dashboard tachometer may be relatively constant (or stay within a range) through all speeds. The transmission, which is where the actual gears are located, takes an input speed from the crankshaft and reduces it to the output speed until the vehicle is in \\x02direct\\x03 drive. In other words, it changes the gear ratios. So, in first gear you might have an input to output ratio of 4 to 1. This means that as the input shaft goes around four times, the output shaft goes around one time. At 4,000 RPMs input you would have 1,000 RPMs output. Second gear may have a 3 to 1 ratio and third gear a 2 to 1 ratio. Fourth gear would be direct drive with a 1 to 1 ratio. \\nThink of the sprockets on a bicycle. There is a large sprocket on the front that rotates as \\nthe bike is pedaled, and there are also large and small sprockets on the back wheel with a chain that connects the front sprocket to the rear sprockets. As the gears are changed, so is the mechanical advantage for the person that is pedaling. \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n57 In direct drive, the input speed and the output speed are the same; there is no gear \\nreduction. Modern vehicles have overdrive, which is a ratio of 0.75 to 1. This means that \\nthe input speed is less than the output speed, which results in better fuel economy on \\nmodern vehicles. \\nThese numbers and ratios are used to present the general idea. Every vehicle has its \\nown input to output ratios. \\nThe drive line (or drive shaft) is a round tube that transfers power from the transmission \\nto a differential. It is situated longitudinally underneath the car. A front-wheel drive vehicle won\\x01t have a drive shaft. Some four-wheel drive vehicles have more than one drive shaft. \\nA differential (aka rear differential in rear-wheel drive vehicles, rear end, or part of the \\nrear axle) has hypoid gears. These are specialized gears which transmit the rotation of the drive shaft 90 degrees in order to turn the axles and correlating wheels and tires. There are spider gears inside the center section of the differential that allow the wheels to travel different distances while turning. Consider a car that is turning right. The driver\\x01s side rear wheel travels a farther distance than the passenger side rear wheel. Think of using a protractor to draw a circle. One leg of the protractor simply rotates on one center spot, while the other leg draws the circle. While the rear wheels of a vehicle don\\x01t turn as sharply as a protractor, the principle is the same. \\nA differential for a German vehicle with cutout to see the inside. \\nImage credit: CC-BY-SA-Aconcagua on Wikipedia \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n58 An illustration of a differential which shows how the gears can be used to change the direction of the \\nrotation.

All of these gears are turning at all times when the engine is running and the \\nclutch is released. When a gear is selected with the gear shift, the gear is being attached to the output shaft. Then to change gears, the clutch is depressed and the next gear is selected which attaches that gear to the output shaft. The gears are manually selected. \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n59 Illustration of a manual transmission . \\nAn automatic transmission uses \\x01sun and planet\\x02 gears. A \\x01sun and planet\\x02 gear set has \\na central \\x01sun\\x02 gear with \\x01planetary\\x02 gears (typically three or four) located around the \\x01sun\\x02 gear. These gears can rotate, turn or hold to create different speeds and directions. To select the gears there are multiple clutch packs and/or bands that are hydraulically applied by a valve body to control gear selection. \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n60 Illustration of sun and planet gears in an automatic transmission.

Refer to the owner\\x03s manual to select the correct fluid. Aftermarket suppliers make fluids that are compatible with multiple different vehicles. When choosing aftermarket fluids, be sure that the specified fluid in the owner\\x03s manual is listed on the aftermarket bottle. \\nLubricants Used in Standard Transmission: \\nThe lubricants used in a standard (or manual) transmission on modern vehicles have \\nmultiple types of fluid. Be sure that the fluid installed in the vehicle meets the \\nmanufacturer's specifications. \\nLubricants Used in Differentials: Most differentials use conventional 80-90 gear oil. The 80-90 numbers indicate the \\nweight and viscosity of the oil. (These are similar to the API and SAE discussed in Chapter 5). Some vehicles require special fluids. Be sure the fluid meets the manufacturer\\x03s specifications. Limited slip differentials may require an additional additive. \\nThe Difference Between Front Wheel Drive, Rear Wheel Drive & Four Wheel Drive: The main differences between front wheel, rear wheel, and four wheel drive are the \\nposition of the drive train parts and where the drive train transmits the energy. \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n61 Illustration of a transaxle which has a transmission and a differential \\nImage credit: CC-BY-SA-Hoikka1 on Wikipedia \\nFront-wheel drive \\nIncludes engine (red), and transaxle. \\nImage credit: CC-BY-SA- Moebiusuibeom-en on Wikipedia \\nA front wheel drive vehicle incorporates a differential and a transmission into one piece, \\ncalled a transaxle.

A brake system uses hydraulic advantage to apply force to a friction material \\nthat generates heat. A moving vehicle has kinetic energy. Brakes convert kinetic energy \\ninto heat energy. \\nThere are two types of brakes: disc brakes and drum brakes. The main differences are \\nthe shapes of the brakes and their friction material. Friction material provides the buffer \\nthat prevents metal from grinding when the brakes are applied. It can withstand the heat that is generated, although it wears out over time and has to be replaced many times throughout the life of the vehicle. \\nDisc brakes have a rotor (disc) for each wheel and brake pads are the friction material. \\nA brake caliper applies force to a brake pad, which presses it against the rotor when it is applied. This generates heat and stops the vehicle. \\nA disc brake. The rotor is the shiny gold-colored disc and the caliper is red.

This generates heat and stops the vehicle. \\nIllustration of a drum brake \\nImage credit: CC-BY-SA-Wapcaplet on Wikipedia \\nDrum brake shoes (violet color) and linings. \\nImage credit: CC-BY-SA-Maly LOLek on Wikipedia \\nThe master cylinder is a hydraulic cylinder that is used to apply force to the brake \\ncalipers and/or wheel cylinders. The wheel cylinders (used in drum brakes) and the brake calipers (used in disc brakes) are both \\x01hydraulic slave cylinders\\x02.  \\nAnti-lock brakes have complex electrical and hydraulic components which are used to \\navoid skidding wheels in a panic stop or in a poor traction condition. The anti-lock brakes (ABS) use signals from each wheel speed sensor to determine if one wheel is \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n66 stopping faster than any of the others. If this occurs, the ABS control module (a \\ncomputer) will signal the ABS hydraulic control unit to isolate that wheel, release brake \\npressure, and then pulsates the brake pressure to maintain equal speeds of all four \\nwheels. This helps avoid skidding and maintains maneuverability during a panic stop. \\nHow to Check the Brake System: \\nThe brake system is often checked by the mechanic during routine oil changes and \\nmaintenance. However, it can also be checked at home. Consult the service manual of the specific make and model about checking the brakes and finding the locations of each part of the brake system. Follow these steps to check the brake system: \\n\\uf0b7Start under the hood.  \\n\\uf0b7Check the brake master cylinder for leaks.  \\n\\uf0b7Check the level and condition of the brake fluid.  \\n\\uf0b7Inspect all lines and the anti-lock brake module for leaks or loose, damaged \\nconnectors. \\n\\uf0b7Raise the vehicle and support it securely on a lift or jack stands (review Lesson 1 \\nif needed) \\n\\uf0b7Remove all four wheels \\n\\uf0b7If the vehicle has drum brakes, then remove the drums. \\n\\uf0b7Inspect all brake lines and hoses for signs of leaking or cracking \\n\\uf0b7Inspect the caliper hardware and dust boots for damage \\n\\uf0b7Inspect the caliper (or wheel cylinders) for brake fluid leaking. \\n\\uf0b7Inspect the rotors for smoothness. If a rotor has any pits or grooves then it will \\nhave to be reconditioned or replaced. \\n\\uf0b7Check the thickness of all the brake pads.  \\nIf there is any variation in the brake pad (or shoe) thickness between the driver side and \\npassenger side, then there may be an adjustment problem, a defective caliper or other defective hardware. Usually the front brakes wear faster since the front brakes are responsible for about 80% of the stopping. There is no blanket measurement for brake pad thickness since the thickness of new pads can vary by make and model of the vehicle. A few millimeters could appear brand new in one car but be an indication for pad replacement in another. If the thickness of the pad is 20% of the original thickness or less, then the pads should be replaced. The original thickness can be found in the service manual for the vehicle. \\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n67 Chapter 11: The Auto Repair Industry \\nConsumers should be aware of how the auto repair industry works. When you bring \\nyour vehicle to an auto repair shop and enter the office, you\\x03re usually greeted by a \\nservice writer. It doesn\\x03t matter if you go to a dealership, a franchised shop (like Midas \\nor Firestone), or a small independent shop -- more often than not, the service writer is the first person you meet. The service writer acts as an intermediary between you and the repair technician. He tells the technician to inspect the car, the technician informs \\nhim what the findings are, and then he comes back to you with the findings. Some \\nshops allow the customer to come into the repair room to see the technician\\x03s findings, but many don\\x03t.  \\nThe service writer is evaluated by upper management, which may include the manager \\nof the shop, a director of one or many shops, and/or the owner. The owners of large \\nshops are not usually onsite and function mostly as investors. They\\x03re hoping to make a return on their investment. Directors may manage multiple shops or be the head of an entire department, such as the service department at a dealership. \\nIllustration of how the auto repair industry is organized \\nSince the service writer is a middleman between the customer and the technician, there \\nare frequent communication problems that can occur. A customer may come into the shop and say that the car makes a squeaking sound when the brakes are applied. The service writer thinks it\\x03s the brake pads, so he tells the technician to inspect the brake pads. There may be nothing wrong with the brake pads. What the service writer should have done is write down that there is a squeaking sound when the brakes are applied. Then the technician can diagnose the problem better. Similar communication issues can also occur in the other direction. The technician may explain problems or findings to the service writer and the service writer may fail to relay the information correctly to the customer. \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n68 The service writer is first and foremost a salesman, not a technician. His knowledge and \\nunderstanding of how a vehicle works is often not any greater than the customer\\x03s. \\nSome service writers can be very knowledgeable about cars; others are not. In either \\ncase, when the customer speaks to him, he will appear to understand what is wrong with the vehicle.  \\nA major problem with the entire industry, from the technicians to upper management, is \\nthat everyone is paid on commission. This means that they are motivated and rewarded \\nto increase sales and raise the price in order to make more money. The services that they suggest are often not damaging to the car; they\\x03re just not necessary. They may say that your cooling system needs a flush when it doesn\\x03t or they could fudge the numbers on maintenance intervals to increase the frequency of services. Maintenance \\nservices are often based on mileage, so it\\x03s easy for a shop to say that a service is \\nrequired at 30,000 miles when it actually isn\\x03t due until 90,000 miles. By changing the interval to every 30,000 miles, they sell the service three times instead of one. This is why it is important to review the maintenance chart in the owner\\x03s manual of the vehicle. Also, some repairs are needed at an earlier time than what is specified in the owner\\x03s manual. This will be based on certain conditions which can include the weather, the driving route, the driver\\x03s habits, and other environmental conditions where the vehicle is driven or parked on a regular basis. \\nAuto dealerships generally have a service department and a sales department which \\nare run as two separate businesses. The sales department is actually a customer to the service department. The sales department is responsible for moving inventory (selling cars on the lot). The service department is responsible for providing services which include inspections, maintenance and repairs. The sales department is a customer to the service department because every vehicle has be inspected and serviced before it can be sold. Since the service writer is still paid by commission even when ordering services for the same dealership, he can often tell the sales department that a particular vehicle can\\x03t be placed out on the lot unless it receives all the top services. Since the sales department wants to sell the vehicle, they have no other choice than to accept the services and pass the additional costs on to the customer. The service department is the one that determines whether a vehicle can be put on the lot, not the sales department. This arrangement can be a safeguard for the vehicles being sold and add protection to buyers. However, it also gives the services writers more control and it is often used to increase commissions. \\nWhen people take their cars to the dealership for maintenance, they are often under the \\nimpression that the dealership has a certified technician performing the repairs. Often the technicians are just kids out of high school with little training or experience. These entry level employees are often called \\x01lube techs\\x02 because traditionally the job only involves changing the oil. However, today some dealerships allow lube techs to perform any repair that they feel comfortable doing, even if they weren\\x03t specifically trained for it. This saves the dealership money because the lube techs aren\\x03t paid as much as the certified technicians.  \\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n69 Illustration of Auto Dealership organization \\nSome shops are sincerely honest, and they do their best to provide good service. Yet, \\nthe system is still flawed. The staff is still paid by commission and the communication gap can still exist between the customer and the repair technician due to the presence of the middleman service writer. \\nAt Crawford\\x01s Auto Repair, we have a completely different system of management. The \\nowners are the technicians and they don\\x01t get paid by commission. There are no service writers. Customers have direct interaction with the technician, who inspects the vehicle. An honest and accurate estimate is given to each customer. The technician only performs the repairs after receiving permission from the customer and customers are always welcome into the repair room to observe the inspections and repairs. Also, we never try to sell unnecessary repairs or services. \\nIllustration of Crawford\\x01s Auto Repair organization - no service writer, no commissions, no unnecessary \\nservices or fees. \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n70 This book is provided to all auto repair consumers free of charge to help them gain a \\nbetter understanding of their vehicle and the auto industry in order to save money.

This chapter offers a beginner\\x01s guide to buying a vehicle. Yet, \\nwhen it comes to buying a vehicle, serious buyers will go beyond the steps described here. For example, this chapter may mention the art of negotiation, yet entire books have been written on the subject of negotiating, and increasing one\\x01s skill in negotiation \\nwill help the buyer to get a better deal. \\nOne of the most important things for potential car buyers to know is that the majority of \\nvehicles depreciate in value over time. If you purchase a new or used vehicle from a dealership, the vehicle depreciates by about 20% of the sale price the minute it is driven \\noff the lot. That means that if you turned around and sold the vehicle within a week, \\nyou\\x01d probably only be able to sell it for about 20% less than you paid for it. It\\x01s not like buying a house where the property generally increases in value over time (except during economic decline). Vehicles are not investments; they\\x01re simply a necessary expense in locations that don\\x01t have good public transportation as an alternative. (They could be investments if you get involved in the collector\\x01s market, which is an entirely different game). \\nIt is also important to realize that the cost in owning a vehicle is much more than simply \\nthe sales price of the vehicle. All expenses must be considered before accepting the burden on your monthly budget. The sales price of the vehicle is just the beginning. If \\nyou\\x01re taking out a loan to pay for the vehicle then you\\x01ll first have the monthly loan \\npayment.  \\nYou\\x01ll also have to pay for gas to run the vehicle. The price of gas varies from week to \\nweek and by location. Wednesday is probably the best day of the week to buy gas. You \\nalso don\\x01t want to fill up while the service truck is at the gas station refilling the storage \\ntanks. When they refill the tanks there are contaminants at the bottom that get stirred up and these contaminants can come through the gas pumps and into your vehicle. Granted, you learned about the fuel filter in Chapter 7, but there is no sense in wearing it out sooner than you have to. Go to www.MapQuest.com  and click on \\x02gas prices\\x03 to \\nfind the best gas prices in your area. The amount of gas that you have to purchase from \\nweek to week will depend on how much you drive and the gas mileage of the vehicle that you purchase. \\nGas mileage is calculated by the change in mileage divided by gallons used (or miles \\nper gallon, MPG). The next time you go to the gas station to refuel, fill the gas tank to full and write down the mileage that appears on your odometer. Then, after you\\x01ve driven for a while, return to the gas station and fill the gas tank to full. The amount of gallons that you purchased is the amount of gas that you used from full tank to full tank after driving for that time. That number goes in the denominator of the equation. The number of gallons will appear on the pump display and on your receipt. When refilling the second time, you\\x01ll also record the mileage on your odometer. The change in \\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n72 mileage is the new mileage recording minus the previous mileage recording, and that \\nnumber goes in the numerator of the equation. \\nWhen shopping for vehicles, you can look up the gas mileage as one of the features. \\n(Go to any page past the home page at www.CrawfordsAutoService.com  to use the free \\ntool on the sidebar). The reported gas mileage is a statistical average that the vehicle \\ngenerally gets and the vehicle that you purchase could get better or worse gas mileage \\ndepending on the condition of the vehicle and the roads where you will be driving. \\nThere will be a monthly fee for vehicle insurance. Insurance fees will vary by the amount \\nof coverage that you want. Liability insurance only pays for any damages that you might cause to the other party when you get in an accident and you are at fault. It won\\x01t pay to replace your vehicle or for your potential medical bills. You\\x01ll also want to consider whether you want roadside service in case the vehicle breaks down, or coverage for car rental fees in case you need a replacement vehicle while your vehicle is repaired. This additional coverage cost more per month. \\nThere are many car insurance companies. Some of the more frequently advertised \\ncompanies are Geico, All State, Progressive, Farmers, Esurance, and Liberty Mutual. Yet, there are many, many others. Their advertisements often tout that by simply giving them a call you could save a significant amount on your monthly insurance bill. That is true because each of their coverage plans are catered to specific types of drivers and these plans change from year to year. Hypothetically, this year Insurance Company A might have better rates for the common commuter with nothing on their driving record, while Insurance Company B might have the best rates for single mothers who are transporting three or more children on a regular basis. When they determine the monthly rate, they take many factors into consideration and many of these factors are company secrets that aren\\x01t publicly announced to potential customers. So, the best way to find the best deal is to get a quote from each company.  \\nSome ways to reduce your monthly insurance cost are to never get a speeding ticket, \\nnever get in an accident, get good grades if you\\x01re a student, get married, be within a certain income bracket (not too low or too high), be female, and stay in frequent contact with the insurance company. Most of these factors are based on statistics. They\\x01re not being sexist or having other forms of bias; they have the research and numbers to justify charging a higher monthly fee for drivers who are at a higher risk. Also, many insurance companies offer discounts if you combine your car insurance with other types of insurance that they offer, such as home owner\\x01s insurance. They call it bundle discounts. \\nShopping for the best car insurance can be a long process. Without a doubt there is a \\nlarge percentage of car insurance customers who are paying more because they\\x01re too \\n\\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n73 intimidated by the research that is required for finding the best deal. You should get \\nused to the idea that you\\x01ll frequently need to call the insurance company and be put on \\nhold to wait for a representative. Be adamant enough with the representatives to get the \\nbest deals and avoid getting ripped off, yet be courteous and professional enough so that the representative will still want to help you. Shopping for car insurance can start simultaneously with shopping for the vehicle. Some companies may be able to help you identify the vehicles with the lowest monthly insurance rates. Yet, some of them might \\nnot be able to provide a quote until you can tell them which vehicle you\\x01ll be driving. \\nBesides the vehicle price, gas and insurance, there will be yearly fees for vehicle \\nregistration. You can find out the yearly registration fee by contacting your local Motor Vehicle Division (MVD or DMV) or your state\\x01s department of transportation. Some \\nstates require vehicle inspections and emissions testing before your vehicle can be \\nregistered. This information is also available at the DMV.  \\nThere will also be costs for maintenance and repair. The best way to reduce these costs \\nis by taking care of the vehicle and following the maintenance chart in the owner\\x01s manual. If the vehicle has a service light illuminated on the dashboard or if the vehicle starts to have symptoms - don\\x01t neglect it. Neglect will lead to further damage, which will require more expensive repairs. A simple example is brake pad replacement. Replacing the brake pads could cost about $200; but if you wait until the pads wear down completely and you start grinding metal on the rotor, then the repair could easily be $800 or more (review Chapter 10 for brakes). If the vehicle is well-maintained, it will last a lot longer -- maybe even 15 years longer or more. Overall, it costs less to maintain a vehicle than to buy new vehicles more frequently. \\nMaintenance costs will be a factor for determining which vehicle to purchase since \\nsome makes and models cost more to maintain than others. Often, a more expensive sales price of the vehicle also means that replacement parts and maintenance will cost more. Some car manufacturers could even have the same part for the basic and sporty models. Yet, if the same part is ordered for the sporty model then it will cost more. The parts manufacturer figures that if the customer could pay for the sportier model then they can also pay more for the part, even if it\\x01s the exact same part with a different label. \\nReview of Vehicle Expenses: \\n\\uf0b7 Sales price/monthly loan payment \\n\\uf0b7 Monthly insurance payment \\n\\uf0b7 Yearly registration fee \\n\\uf0b7 State inspection fees \\n\\uf0b7 Gas \\n\\uf0b7 Regular maintenance \\n\\uf0b7 Repairs \\nOnce you\\x01re able to determine a ballpark figure for your monthly expenses of owning a \\nvehicle, you\\x01ll be ready to start shopping. Some people find more comfort in purchasing a vehicle from a dealership because the organization within a brick and mortar facility \\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n74 gives them a false sense of security. The problem with purchasing from a dealership is \\nthat they add unnecessary services and fees. For example, in Arizona they might add a \\n\\x01desert care package\\x02 and it will be listed with all the other fees. Since most customers \\ndon\\x03t know what the desert care package is, they don\\x03t ask about it. It essentially means that they tinted the windows without asking if you wanted it, and they will absolutely be charging you more than it would cost to tint the windows privately. They might also list \\x01theft protection\\x02 as one of the fees. This means that they had a technician etch a \\nnumber into the windows. They might charge $200 for this service which takes the \\ntechnician about 10-15 minutes to perform. Also, if you\\x03re vehicle gets stolen, the police department won\\x03t use this number to identify your vehicle. They\\x03ll use the VIN (vehicle identification number). \\nThe dealership will have many tricks for justifying an increased price on the bottom line. \\nYou can avoid some of these expenses by going through each item on the list and asking them to describe exactly what this means. Don\\x03t accept the sales description; tell them to really explain it. Then, if you don\\x03t want it on the bill, tell them to take it off. If you buy from a dealership you can expect to spend the entire day there. Dealerships also offer poor trade-in value for your prior vehicle. \\nIf you decide to buy from a dealership, the best time of the year to buy is December, \\nparticularly on Christmas Eve and New Year\\x03s Eve. In any given month, the inventory on the lot isn\\x03t necessarily owned by the dealership. They have the vehicles on a \\x01floor money\\x02 loan. If they don\\x03t keep the vehicle beyond a certain time period, they don\\x03t have to pay interest on the loan, and they make the profit from the sale without an additional expense. If you happen to pick a vehicle that is near the end of its loan period, then the dealership might be willing to sell it at a cheaper price. December is a particularly good time since people are more willing to buy during the holidays and the dealerships want to increase their sales numbers before the end of the year. This makes them more willing to negotiate, regardless of whether the loan period for the vehicle is ending. \\nIf you buy from a private owner, there is no guarantee that they won\\x03t tell you little white \\nlies about the vehicle in order to get you to buy it. However, a private owner won\\x03t be as likely to trick you into spending more for the vehicle than it\\x03s worth. There are tools that you can use to determine the value of the vehicle, and give you a more accurate starting point for a fair price. \\nBefore deciding which vehicle to purchase, you\\x03ll want to write down some of the \\nfeatures you want, or decide on the purposes that the vehicle will serve. A pickup truck might make an excellent working vehicle, but the gas mileage could make it a lousy commuter vehicle. Will it be meant for one driver or more than one driver? How many passengers will be transported on a regular basis? Do you need a lot of trunk space? Do you plan on driving it until it dies, or will you sell it once it reaches a certain age or mileage? If you know that you\\x03ll eventually sell it, then you\\x03ll want to pick a make and model with a good reputation for resale value. All these features and more will help determine which vehicle you should look for. \\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n75 If you buy from a private owner, the shopping will begin within the comfort of your own \\nhome. Some resources to find cars for sale include www.Craigslist.org , \\nwww.AutoTrader.com  (and the Auto Trader print publication), Yahoo! Autos \\n(autos.yahoo.com ), www.Cars.com , and many free publications which are given away \\nat local gas stations and outside public libraries. \\nWhen you find a vehicle that interests you, look up the make and model on Kelly \\nBluebook ( www.KBB.com ) to see the listed value. Sometimes a seller will list it for \\nhigher than the Kelly Bluebook price on purpose. There could be a variety of reasons for \\ndoing this, which include: hesitation to sell the vehicle, hope to sell it for more, upgrades which the owner added, or simply the expectation to negotiate. \\nIf the vehicle says \\x01OBO\\x02, it means \\x01or best offer\\x02. This is an open invitation to \\nnegotiate. There may also be a variety of other abbreviations, especially if the ad is in print. Printed advertising fees are based on the number of characters or words, so the seller is trying to save money on the ad. If there is ever an abbreviation that you don\\x03t understand, look for an abbreviation key in the publication or look it up online. \\nIf the vehicle has a \\x01restored title\\x02, that means that at one time the vehicle had enough \\ndamage that the cost of repair was more than the total value of the vehicle. It may have been in an accident, flood, or other event to cause the damage. The repairs can include anything from engine repair to cosmetic changes to the vehicle. Generally, restored titles are less expensive, but the risk that there is something wrong is much greater. \\nOnce you find a vehicle you\\x03re interested in, call or email the owner for more \\ninformation. Since the ad may not have all the information you need, here are some questions you might want to ask: \\nGo through the features listed on Kelly Blue Book and gather any information you \\nneed that is not on the ad (Is it a two door or four door? Does it have a CD player, etc.) \\nIf you\\x03re a non-smoker, was the vehicle ever driven by a smoker? A smoker \\nwouldn\\x03t care much either way, but a non-smoker will find it\\x03s very difficult to get the smell of smoke out. Smokers who know they\\x03ll sell their vehicle eventually should never smoke in that vehicle because it reduces the resale value. \\nHas it had its regular maintenance? Oil changes at 5,000 miles? Etc. -- A vehicle \\nwith 100,000 miles that has had regular maintenance is better than a vehicle with 20,000 miles and never been maintained. \\n\\x01Would it be OK if I test drove it to my mechanic as part of the evaluation?\\x02 Is the Carfax provided? -- A Carfax is a report of all the times the vehicle has had \\nan insurance claim for repairs. ( http://www.Carfax.com ) If you buy from a \\ndealership, they usually include the Carfax. If you buy from a private owner, they \\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n76 may or may not provide the Carfax since it costs extra. Auto Trader online has a \\nplace which indicates if the Carfax is available. \\nWhat was the car used for and where was it driven most of the time? Were dirt \\nroads a part of the regular commute? Etc. -- Some of the best vehicles were only driven to the grocery store and home by an old lady who never went anywhere else and always took care of her things. Buying a used car from an organization \\nwho regularly kept them maintained for top reliable performance can also be a \\ngood source, such as an LDS Mission or a business. \\nIs the price negotiable?  \\nIf you\\x03re satisfied with the phone or email interview, then you\\x03ll schedule a time with the \\nowner for seeing the vehicle. \\nAfter reading this book, you\\x03ll have a much greater advantage when evaluating a \\npotential vehicle for purchase. You\\x03ll know to check the dashboard lights, the horn, the exterior lights, the battery, and many other parts of the vehicle because now you\\x03re familiar with how a vehicle works. You\\x03ll want to make sure it comes with a complete spare tire kit. Try looking down the side of the vehicle at different angles to see how the light reflects off the paint. If you detect two different coats of paint or areas where touch up paint has been applied then ask the seller about it. If the side panels and doors look smooth from one angle but then you detect some waviness when looking from a different angle, then the vehicle may have been in a side-impact collision and its safety features could be compromised. \\nYou\\x03ll want to test drive the vehicle. See how it handles, accelerates and brakes. Go to \\na stretch of road like a freeway onramp or a long stretch between street lights where you can floor it. At some point in the inspection, you\\x03ll ask for a Carfax report or any of the information the seller might have on previous maintenance and repairs. \\nOne of the smartest things you can do is take the car to a trusted mechanic as part of \\nthe evaluation. Find a place where you can develop a direct working relationship with the technician and not a service writer (review Chapter 11 for a description of service writers). Crawford\\x03s Auto Repair would be your best choice for a pre-purchase inspection if you live in the Mesa-Chandler-Gilbert area of Arizona. Some shops offer a free estimate but if they know you\\x03re requesting the evaluation to buy a vehicle, then they might charge for the inspection since there is less of a chance of you buying their repair services. The inspection fee will be worth it because the trained eye of the mechanic and the tools they use for diagnostics will enable them to spot things that you don\\x03t even know to look for. They\\x03ll look at the body of the vehicle from the inside, raise it up and look at the drive train and the underside of the engine, the brakes, and they\\x03ll attach their diagnostic device to the vehicle computer to receive any trouble codes that are stored on the vehicle\\x03s computer. A mechanic\\x03s inspection will tell you much more information than simply looking at the vehicle or test driving it yourself. And a seller who is confident in the value of the vehicle will allow you have it evaluated by a mechanic. \\n\\nCrawford\\x01s Guide to Beginners Auto Maintenance & Repair  www.CrawfordsAutoService.com \\n77 After a personal inspection of the vehicle and the mechanic\\x03s inspection, if possible \\nyou\\x03ll want to use an internet-enabled device to go through the Kelly Blue Book estimate \\nagain. Now that you have more information, you\\x03ll be able to get a more accurate estimate from Kelly Blue Book. Also, ask the mechanic for his best estimate on what the vehicle is worth. Between Blue Book and the mechanic, keep this baseline estimate in mind and do not go over it when negotiating. First of all, are you willing to pay this \\nbaseline estimate for the vehicle? If you don\\x03t want the vehicle enough to negotiate, \\nthen just let the owner know that after evaluating the vehicle you\\x03re not interested. If you are interested then you can start negotiating. \\nConsider the asking price of the vehicle. Is it lower than your baseline estimate? If it is, \\nthen it\\x03s your new baseline and do not go above it. If the asking price is above your \\nbaseline estimate then still do not go above your baseline. You\\x03ll want to make a counter offer to be as low as it can be without being offensive. It should at least be a couple hundred dollars lower than the Kelly Blue Book estimate. And you\\x03ll use the information you gathered during the inspection to justify the lower offer. If it needs a repair, then you\\x03ll mention that the price of the repair should be deducted from the asking price. \\nBe patient. Do not get excited to buy a vehicle. Read the seller\\x03s body language. Hold \\nyour ground. Read a book on negotiation, or many books. There is so much to this art and usually the better negotiator gets the deal he or she wants while the other person makes compromises. If you\\x03re too anxious to buy the vehicle or if you\\x03re too lazy to go through the process of calling sellers and inspecting a vehicle more than once, then you\\x03ll probably pay more. Expect to go through this process a few times before finding a satisfying deal. \\nAfter you agree on a price, the seller will take the title to the Division of Motor Vehicles \\n(DMV) or a private title shop and get the title notarized for selling the vehicle. You might use that time to go to the bank or a title loan store to get the money to pay for the vehicle. You can arrange for the best type of payment with the seller. If you pay for it in full from your bank account, then paying with a cashier\\x03s check made out to the seller may be more secure than carrying cash. Then you and the seller will meet up again to trade the payment for the title and keys. After you receive the title, you\\x03ll have to take it to the DMV or to an independent title service shop to have a new title drawn up in your name and get your license plate. Within the next 10 days you\\x03ll also need to call the insurance company to have the new vehicle added to your current coverage plan or purchase new insurance. \\nFinding the right vehicle for your needs at the right price will be very rewarding. If you do \\nyour homework, put in the effort and follow the steps in this chapter, then you\\x03ll be able to find a good vehicle that you can afford.
